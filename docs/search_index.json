Here are a few usefull ressources to familiarize yourself with R: Data camp course: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r Base R package cheat sheet is available at: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf other R package cheat sheets: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ "],
["login.html", "Section 2 Project set up 2.1 Log in to RStudio 2.2 Install and load packages 2.3 Log in to Opal", " Section 2 Project set up 2.1 Log in to RStudio First, open up your web browser and go to https://obiba.erasmusmc.nl:8445/. This is the URL for the MINDMAP RStudio instance from which all researchers will analyse data. Enter the username and password provided for this tutorial. Figure 2.1: Login to the web RStudio with username and password provided for the workshop Once logged in to RStudio, open the workshop_scripts.R file located in the Files tab in the bottom right corner of the RStudio environment. As the name suggests, this is an .R file in which scripts for this tutorial are saved. 2.2 Install and load packages Next, we need load R packages we are going to use in this tutorial. To do so, execute the following lines in your R session using the library() command. To execute a script from an R file, place your cursor on the line and Type Ctrl-R. # Load required libraries for this tutorial library(opal) library(tidyverse) library(epiDisplay) library(lme4) library(car) Note: we have pre-installed required R packages in your R environment. For your own analyses, you may need to install additional packages at a later date. This is done by using the install.packages() command and writing the name of the package in quotations (e.g. install.packages(“tidyverse”)). 2.3 Log in to Opal In order to access harmonized data from RStudio, we need to log in to the Opal server, which hosts the harmonized data for the RECORD and GLOBE studies. To do so, execute the following line of script in this file: # Create an object with your Opal login information (password and username) - these are hidden in your .Rprofile file. erasmus_opal &lt;- opal.login() This saves your Opal username and password in a object called erasmus_opal. Next, assign the data you want to use in your R session. You can either assign an entire table, or a subset of variables from a table using the variables argument: #Assign RECORD data opal.assign.table.tibble(erasmus_opal, &#39;record_data&#39;, &#39;WORKSHOP.DS_RECORD&#39;) #opal.assign.table.tibble(erasmus_opal, &#39;record_data&#39;, &#39;WORKSHOP.DS_RECORD&#39;, variables = list(&quot;sdc_age_0&quot;,&quot;sdc_gender_0&quot;,&quot;sdc_highest_edu_0&quot;)) #Assign GLOBE data opal.assign.table.tibble(erasmus_opal, &#39;globe_data&#39;, &#39;WORKSHOP.DS_GLOBE&#39;) #opal.assign.table.tibble(erasmus_opal, &#39;globe_data&#39;, &#39;WORKSHOP.DS_GLOBE&#39;,variables = list(&quot;sdc_age_0&quot;,&quot;sdc_gender_0&quot;,&quot;sdc_highest_edu_0&quot;,&quot;sdc_income_0&quot;,&quot;sdc_livstat_0&quot;,&quot;sdc_retire_0&quot;,&quot;phy_bmi_all_0&quot;,&quot;poh_sah_good_0&quot;,&quot;poh_sah_poor_0&quot;,&quot;lsb_smk_status_0&quot;)) Last, create dataframes in RStudio for your analyses using the following scripts: #Dataframe for RECORD data record_data &lt;- opal.execute(erasmus_opal,&#39;record_data&#39;) #Dataframe for GLOBE data globe_data &lt;- opal.execute(erasmus_opal,&#39;globe_data&#39;) The &lt;- is an assignment operator in R. It creates an object with what is written to its right. You’ll notice that when you run the two lines above, dataframes appear in the upper right hand corner window under the Environment tab, indicating the name of the dataframe, the number of observations and number of variables.

["descriptives.html", "Section 3 Descriptive statistics 3.1 Inspect the dataframe 3.2 Measures of central tendancy and variability 3.3 Categorical variables 3.4 Graphs and plots 3.5 Pooled statistics", " Section 3 Descriptive statistics This section will give you a brief overview of how to generate descriptive statistics in R. Note: For this section and all subsequent section, use ? in front of a function name to retrieve help files on this function. 3.1 Inspect the dataframe To see collumn names, use the colnames() function: # See variable names # GLOBE colnames(globe_data) # RECORD colnames(record_data) The head() function gives you the variable names, types, and the 6 first lines of values in a dataset. # Inspect GLOBE and RECORD datasets # GLOBE head(globe_data) # RECORD head(record_data) 3.2 Measures of central tendancy and variability Basic R functions for computing descriptive statistics include: mean() - returns the mean of a numeric variable sd() - returns the standard deviation of a numeric variable var() - returns de median of a numeric variables min() - returns de minimum of a numeric variables maximum() - returns de maximum of a numeric variables median()- returns de median of a numeric variables range() - returns the range of values of a numeric variables (minimum and maximum) IQR() - returns the interquartile range of a numeric variables # Mean age for GLOBE baseline collection wave mean(globe_data$sdc_age_0) # Mean age for RECORD baseline collection wave mean(record_data$sdc_age_0) The summary() command returns several desciptive statistics summaries for numeric variables. you can either run this command for a single variable or for an entire dataframe. For a single variable, this function return the mean, median, 25th and 75th quartiles, minimum and maximum values. When applied to a dataframe, this command generates these stastitics for all collumns in this dataframe. # Summary of the GLOBE baseline collection wave age variable summary(globe_data$sdc_age_0) # Summary of the entire GLOBE dataframe summary(globe_data) The summ() function from the epiDisplay package is also quite usefull. In addition to the number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and number of missing values, it also generates a plot showing the distribution of the variable. 3.3 Categorical variables For factor variables (i.e. categorical variables), the table() function returns the number of observation per category. # Number of Males/Females in GLOBE table(globe_data$sdc_gender_0) # Number of Males/Females in RECORD table(record_data$sdc_gender_0) Wrapping this function in prop.table() give the proportion of Males and Females in each study. # Proportion of Males/Females in GLOBE prop.table(table(globe_data$sdc_gender_0)) # Proporion of Males/Females in RECORD prop.table(table(record_data$sdc_gender_0)) Again, the epiDisplay package provides a useful function to summarise categorical data. Running the tab1() function gives you the frequency and proportion for each category and generates a histogram for a variable. Missing data are also shown in tables and histograms. # Proportion of Males/Females in GLOBE tab1(globe_data$sdc_gender_0) # Proporion of Males/Females in RECORD tab1(record_data$sdc_gender_0) 3.4 Graphs and plots R also allows you to generate graphics and plots to visualise the harmonized data. For example, you can create a box plot using the boxplot() function or a histogram using the hist() function. # Box plot and histogram of age at baseline for GLOBE Study boxplot(globe_data$sdc_age_0) hist(record_data$sdc_age_0) # Box plot and histogram of age at baseline for RECORD boxplot(record_data$sdc_age_0) hist(record_data$sdc_age_0) Note: access the help files using ?boxplot and ?hist to learn how to format your box plot or histogram, including how to create a title for your graph, label axes, add colour or subset observations or apply breaks to numerical data. 3.5 Pooled statistics For pooled analyses, we will need a study indicator variable that will adjust for study effect in regression models (Section 5) . The following script creates a new collumn in each dataset called study and gives it a value of ‘RECORD’ for all observations in record_data and GLOBE for all observations in globe_data. # Create a new column called study and assign values of 0 (for RECORD) and 1 (for GLOBE) record_data[&#39;study&#39;]= &quot;RECORD&quot; globe_data[&#39;study&#39;]= &quot;GLOBE&quot; Next, we use the rbind() command to combine globe_data and record_data into a single pooled dataset. # Combine dataframes into a pooled dataset using the rbind command pooled_data &lt;- rbind(globe_data, record_data) You can play around with the functions outlined above to get descriptive statistics for the pooled dataset.

["cross-sectional.html", "Section 4 Cross-sectional analyses 4.1 Linear regression 4.2 Logistic regression", " Section 4 Cross-sectional analyses In this section, simple examples of cross-sectional linear and logistic regressions for single studies and for pooled data are presented. 4.1 Linear regression The glm() function allows fitting a generalized linear regression model. The example below is a corss-sectional (baseline assessment data) linear regression with body mass index as the outcome and age, sex, education level, household income and smoking status as predictor variables. # GLM for BMI using GLOBE study glm_bmi &lt;- glm(phy_bmi_all_0 ~ sdc_age_0 + sdc_gender_0 + sdc_highest_edu_0 + sdc_income_0 + lsb_smk_status_0, family = gaussian, data = globe_data) Using the &lt;- assignment operator allows us to store the results of this analysis in an R object called glm_bmi. Applying the summary() function on this object allows us to see the results. # See linear regression results summary(glm_bmi) The glm() function can also be applied to a categorical outcome by specifi 4.2 Logistic regression For "],
["longitudinal.html", "Section 5 Longitudinal analyses 5.1 Long to wide format 5.2 Example two", " Section 5 Longitudinal analyses Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. 5.1 Long to wide format For longitudinal analyses, we need to transform each dataframe (GLOBE and RECORD) from long to wide format. The following scripts does this transformation and saves the new dataframes as globe_data_long and record_data_long. # GLOBE: wide to long format globe_data_long &lt;- globe_data %&gt;% gather(var, value, -entity_id, -study) %&gt;% separate(var, into = c(&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), sep = (&quot;_(?=[^_]+$)&quot;)) %&gt;% spread(variable, value) # RECORD: wide to long format record_data_long &lt;- record_data %&gt;% gather(var, value, -entity_id, -study) %&gt;% separate(var, into = c(&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;time&quot;), sep = (&quot;_(?=[^_]+$)&quot;)) %&gt;% spread(variable, value) 5.2 Example two "],
